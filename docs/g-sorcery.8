.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBg\-sorcery\fP is aimed to provide you with easy way of integration of 3rd party software
providers with Gentoo.
.sp
3rd party software provider is a software distribution like CTAN, CPAN or ELPA.
Usualy there is a lot of software available in such a distribution and very few or no ebuilds
for it.
.sp
\fBg\-sorcery\fP is a project aimed to implement a framework for ebuild generators (backends)
for 3rd party software providers. The CLI tool g\-sorcery is designed to be called rather
by appropriate backends then by user. If you are not a backend developer and just want to
manage your overlay see documentation for a backend you want to use.
.sp
There are two ways of using \fBg\-sorcery\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
use it with \fBlayman\fP
.sp
In this case all you need to do is install \fBlayman\-9999\fP, \fBg\-sorcery\fP
and appropriate backend. Then you should just run \fIlayman \-L\fP as
root and find an overlay you want. Type of overlay will be
displayed as \fIg\-sorcery\fP\&. Then you add this overlay as
usual. It\(aqs all you need to do and it\(aqs the recommended way of
using \fBg\-sorcery\fP and backends.
.IP \(bu 2
use it as stand\-alone tool (not recommended)
.sp
In this case you should create an overlay (see \fBportage\fP documentation), sync it and populate
it with one or more ebuilds. Then ebuilds could be installed by emerge or by \fBg\-sorcery\fP tool
or backend.

.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fIBACKEND\fP
Backend to be used.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-overlay\fP \fIOVERLAY\fP, \fB\-o\fP \fIOVERLAY\fP
Overlay directory. This option is mandatory if there is no
\fBdefault_overlay\fP entry in a backend config.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-repository\fP \fIREPO\fP, \fB\-r\fP \fIREPO\fP
Repository name. If there is more than one repository available
for a given backend must be specified.
.UNINDENT
.SH COMMANDS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBsync\fP
Synchronize a repository database.
.TP
.B \fBlist\fP
List packages available in a repository.
.TP
.B \fBgenerate\fP
Generate a given ebuild and all its dependencies.
.TP
.B \fBinstall\fP
Generate and install an ebuild using your package mangler.
.TP
.B \fBgenerate\-tree\fP
Generate entire overlay structure. Without option \fB\-d\fP after
this command sources are not fetched during generation and there
are no entries for them in Manifest files.
